<h3 style="padding-right: 300px; padding-left: 300px;">
1. Break 6 to 7 slices of breads and add in a mixer or dry grinder. You can use any bread like white, brown, multi grain or whole wheat bread. Grind to a fine consistency. Take the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Keep aside. bread crumbs are used to bind the veg patties. Coating the veg patties with bread crumbs while frying also makes them crisp.

2.  Now rinse and steam 3 large potatoes, 1 medium to large carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓  to ½ cup green peas till they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the veggies in a pressure cooker for 3 whistles. You can also cook in a pan or in an electric cooker. Once cooked drain well the veggies. There should be no water or moisture in them.

Stir and mix the spices with the rest of the mixture. Switch off the flame and then add the chopped coriander leaves or fresh parsley.Stir very well and add this sauteed onion mixture to the mashed veggies.Add salt as per taste and 5 to 6 tbsp bread crumbs.Make the size of the veg patties same as the size of the buns. If the mixture looks soft or crumbles, then do add some more breadcrumbs and mix everything again very well. Cover the veg patties and keep aside.

6.Slice the burger buns in equal halves.Spread some butter on the burger bun slices.Heat a small pan and toast the buttered side of the burger bun slice. For a vegan option, toast the burger bun with little oil.The buttered side should become lightly crisp and golden. Toast all the burger buns this way. If you want you can toast the second side too.Place the vegetable patty.
